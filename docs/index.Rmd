# Expectations

## Opportunity to share your research to others

+ If you are planning on presenting your research at a conference the graduate handbook (updated January 1, 2020) stipulates this: 

<usc-blockquote>"All presentations that students give personally must be practiced in front of a group of faculty no later than two weeks before the conference start date. The DGS will organize a group of faculty to observe the presentation."</usc-blockquote>

+ IRCP is an opportunity to fulfill this requirement by presenting in front of faculty and other graduate students. 

+ This is a good opportunity to let people know what you are interested in, get valuable feedback, and stimulate collaboration.

# Expectations
## Opportunity to talk about research you are interested in with others
